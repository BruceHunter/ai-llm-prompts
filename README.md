## Example of a Step and Stop prompt

This way you give it all the context up front. This will help make responses better.
This is a prompt optimization.

**Prompt Input:**
```
Step1: 
    1. Create a socket server with node.js.

Stop and wait until I say Step2.

Step2:
    1. Create a dockerfile for the output given from Step1.

Stop and wait until I say Step3 or give Step3.
```

**Target:** Model: GPT-4
